                <p>Hi! My name is Andrew! I am fairly new to coding, but that will not deter me from doing my best! I have a Bachelor's Degree in Philosophy. My study focus was in logic and argumentative reasoning. Coding takes a very logical mind and I have been preparing my whole life for this.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am very passionate about many things! I have worked in the video game industry as a Quality Assurance Tester, giving me a leg up in testing and understanding expected behavior. I have also been part of corporate back offices and launched products to employees and took care of any issues that would arise. I have worked in most industries and in most positions available. This lets me draw on a pool of experience that is varying in perspective than most people. On my free time you can usually find me writing lore to a fantasy realm, model kit building, playing video games or attempting to satiate my appetite for knowledge!
                <br>
                <br>
                Please take a look around!
