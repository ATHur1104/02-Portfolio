# 02-Portfolio
## My Personal Porfolio
### I wanted to make a website that would be able to showcase my projects as well as a website that I can constantly update with any new projects
## Technology Used
* HTML
    * Using basic html to anchor and link parts of the website to other places on the webpage and outside the webpage
* CSS
    * Using style sheets to control the location of objects on the webpage as well as setting attributes to objects to move and transform. Making the webpage viewable when changing screen size
* GitHub
    * Using GitHub to push and pull projects.

Resources Used (If you used any code from anywhere or got help from a specific article, link to it here. i.e. if a Stackoverflow page was particularly helpful!)
